                <p>Hello, my name is Mikolaj Lukasik, I am a student at University of the West of Scotland, studying BS Web and Mobile Development.</p>
                <p>I am working as a Junior Software Developer at Traveltek, where I went from creating front ends for travel search engines to creating and maintaining internal company scripts and software.</p>
                <p>In my own time I am learning to create iOS and macOS apps. I use Apple products, so I want to know how to make software for them.</p>

                        <h2>What makes a good portfolio or showreel?</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        I am not sure if I am the best person to decide on that topic, or to give my advice, taken I focus mostly on logic of my applications, which is rather hard to visually convey, I think I can still produce some good ideas about presenting your work. Let me focus on mobile apps and website, as I know how to work with them.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Summarize your work on the project.</h4>
                    <p>
                        You know what you did on a task: whether it’s implementing the user reports, designing icons for UI, programming networking algorithms, or tweaking colours to add dark mode. Spend some time pointing out which parts of the project are your own. It will help you when somebody asks exactly what your specialisation is. It will help you realise what you like to do. It will show the world, what you can do. And if you did the whole project, from idea and design to publishing in App Store, write it down. Let people see how much work goes in all those apps.
                    </p>

                    <img src="../img/cards.jpg" alt="My portfolio cards">
                    <h4>Start with the best.</h4>
                    <p>
                        Things you are the proudest of will be in the spotlight at the top / start – most prominent, bold, and interesting. Do you know how many people go to second page on Google results? <a href="https://www.theleverageway.com/blog/how-far-down-the-search-engine-results-page-will-most-people-go/">About 5 percent.</a> This is why the order of your work matters – you have interest of people watching your work just for a very short time, and you have to make the best of it.

                    </p>
                    <h4>Name your favourites.</h4>
                    <p>
                        A good name for project needs to have some meaning in it. Especially when it is in portfolio, because it is something you are very proud of. When you name it – it’s your own. That’s why on top of all the work you did, a name will make your work more complete and more desirable, even if it’s just something straight out of tutorial. It will give your project that much needed personality. And for pragmatists: named projects are easier to sort.

                    <h4>Images? Good. Videos? Better</h4>
                    <p>
                        Yes, I can see what your app looks like. Even with that annoying overlay of new phone I still did not buy. But I want to do more. I want to see how your app is used. How easy it is to do that thing I am willing to pay £1.99 a month to do. Don’t overdo it and present all little functions (this should be done on specialised product site) but give me a quick look and feel of that one thing I will be doing over and over.

                    <h4>You can brag. A lot!</h4>
                    <p>
                        I have created a Chrome extension that is currently used by almost 7000 people all over the world. I have been invited to work with Electronic Arts. I earned my first front end internship after my first year of university. Your portfolio is the place you present the best, most intense version of yourself, and there is absolutely no reason to be humble. Write down all the big successes, and make your awesome self stand out.
