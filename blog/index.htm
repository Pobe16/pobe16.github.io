                    <h2>The importance of networking within the creative industries.</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                        When you are working with computers you need good networking, because without the networking you will not have Internet, and without Internet current computers are losing about 90% of their functionality. Now that we understand that simple fact and really want to get to topic on point, let’s see what exactly networking is, when it comes to people. But first and foremost, here is a quick and simple explanation, why it’s good to network, or in different words, know a lot of people:
                </p>
                
                <h4>Recruiting good employees is expensive.</h4>
                <p>
                    That’s the reason a lot of jobs (and not only full time, but also part time, contracts, temporary positions, all types really) are first advertised internally – it’s much cheaper to ask current employees if they know somebody who would be good for the position – even with a sign-up bonus. To advertise a job externally, means get a lot of bodies in company involved in searching for “The One”. And their time is often limited, and well… expensive.
                </p>
                <img src="../img/six_degrees_of_separation.jpg" alt="Home Office">

                <h4>Six degrees of separation.</h4>
                <p>
                    There are different types of networking. We already talked a bit about networking to find a job, but it is also a good idea to network with people who are on the border of what you currently are doing. Company usually dealing with creating web services might need to develop a handheld application. Video game studio got next level of funding through Kickstarter and now they need to hire an animator, to create vibrant cutscenes. If a person knows a lot of people within the creative industry, they are very valuable asset to company. Some may say they just know a guy, who know a guy, who know a guy. But those connections in right hands are invaluable.  
                </p>

                <h4>We live in a society.</h4>
                <p>
                    I think there is also another, very important aspect: social. Just the act of networking itself is a great social experience, but all those new connections are people. And relationships with people are fascinating – some of them might give you a job, others an hour of laughter. There is whole colourful spectrum of human interaction, and you can use it to be better person, and a better professional in your area of expertise.
                </p>

                <h4>Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.</h4>
                <p>
                    I really like the simple guide to networking presented in above screenshot from a wonderful movie, “Princess Bride”.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Start with a polite greeting.</li>
                        <li>State your name.</li>
                        <li>Provide a relevant personal link.</li>
                        <li>Set expectations for the relationship.</li>
                    </ol>
                    I have been networking at university events, at developer meetups, graduate fairs. I think all students should be going out there to present what they can do, meet people in industry, and get a chance for work. I pushed myself to attend all meetings I could find, and in the end,  I have found a company willing to take me in for an internship. What did I say?
                </p>

                    <h2>Working in the creative industries: is freelancing the road to success?</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                        A lot of fresh and seasoned developers are stands in front of a choice between working full time in someone else’s company or creating their own one-person enterprise. What divide those two choices, and in what areas are they similar? What type of person works better in each of those type of work?
                </p>
                <img src="../img/home-office.jpg" alt="Home Office">
                <h4>From bed to office in ten easy steps…</h4>
                <p>
                    Let’s simply name some good things about freelancing:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Bigger contract rates – freelancers earn more, because you are getting paid for all the extra stuff the company usually take care off. And then some more on top!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            No boss to tell how to do the job – contracts are usually constructed to give the freelancer full control on how they work.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Freelancer is not restricted by time and place they work. There is no need to take a day off to go to dentist – you can just have that appointment, and then schedule your work hours after that. Also – you set your own AC temperature at your workplace.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Work on projects that really interest you – you have the full capability of choosing contracts that suits them. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            No need to contact a lot of people – means you are less likely to get sick during flu season, you can exercise in the time off work, you don’t need to spend a lot of time commuting.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <img src="../img/stress_office.jpg" alt="Stressed person behind monitor">
                <h4>But is it really my thing?</h4>
                <p>
                    But you also have to take into account some not so great sides of the gig:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Responsibility for all areas of the project – good when one is a jack of all trades, but if that is not the case, some of that sweet contract money will have to be spent on hiring people who will need to help you. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Your clients are your bosses now. They are not as in your face as in a full-time job, but they are still there. Sometimes for better when they just want a finished product, sometimes for worse when they are changing their mind every 5 minutes, then are late with final decision.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            No work stability – there might be time, when you will not get enough contracts to cover your expenses. The money for contracts is usually bigger, but you have to treat it better – predict extra expenses, holidays, etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Lack of human contact. This one of course depends on what type of person you are. Some people work best when they are surrounded by other, similarly focused people. Other need a total isolation, peace and quiet.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Freelancing is competitive. Mostly because of the low entry requirements: creating something from the comfort of one’s home, with not a lot of special equipment needed (a computer you use every day will suffice), result in an easy start for a lot of people, who then have to build their brand.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h4>Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.</h4>
                <p>
                        To finish everything up, I would like to present a video from one of my programming mentors, where he talks about how his daily routine works, as a freelance mobile app developer. Here is Sean Allen.

                    <h2>Does the concept of professionalism apply to the creative industries?</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    There are some details concerning jobs of programmers and computer graphic artist that make them hard to include in the boundaries of professionalism. <a href="https://brainhub.eu/blog/do-software-developers-need-college-degrees/">A lot of people in these areas of work are not professionally educated to a degree standard</a> – they are self-taught at home, often from sources they find themselves and learn by trial and error. There is no required age, no specified set of qualifications a person needs to know, no unions, nor societies that decide if person is capable of working as a software engineer or CGI artist. But there are other ways professionalism is, in a way expected from people working in creative industries. 
                </p>
                <img src="../img/linkedin.jpg" alt="LinkedIn app icon">
                <h4>Work contract and socially connected world as a base for professionalism.</h4>
                <p>
                    When looking for work on a permanent contract, or as a freelancer / contractor, programmers and computer graphic artists are considered for a job based on their previous experience. Usually public, presented as a portfolio, or just hidden, but uncovered on request. Their professional profiles are connected, containing references from people who worked with them previously. This is in a way a proof the person is capable of doing the job. People we connect to will talk of our good and bad sides. All good deeds are remembered. The same goes for bad ones, but to top it up – they are shared all around the world. That is why it’s important to be <a href="https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/what-six-distinct-traits-professionalism-767892">ethical, committed and responsible</a> in work one undertake. And that is why the job does not normally end when developer / graphic artist leaves the office.
                </p>
                <img src="../img/computer-repair-hammer.jpg" alt="DO NOT USE HAMMER TO FIX YOUR COMPUTER">
                <h4>Certifications in IT. Not always needed, but some areas require them.</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the beauties of working with computers is they are everywhere. And work of programmers and CGI artists can be intertwined with other disciplines: from banking and governing, through religion and travels, even to gaming and cooking? There are ways of using computers in every type of work, and some of those require certifications. Working with children require a background check. Government and banking jobs need confidentiality contracts for people working with personal data. This type of certifications sometimes just check what person is like in their professional life, other times it will check if a person is an upstanding citizen without any law breaking in their records.
                </p>
                

                <h4>That one place where professionals are always needed.</h4>
                <p><img src="../img/space_jam.png" alt="Space Jam website">
                    Is not exactly one place. There are multitude of places responsible for development of all widely used programming language – people who set standards after carefully considering needs of current and future users, and make sure new standards will not break current technology (or ancient, like the Space Jam website). These committees usually consist of senior software engineers, but submissions for new standards can be made by people with all type of experience. That is because everyone can have an outstanding idea, but it takes a lot of proficient people to make sure it does not already exist, figure out details and standardize it, explain the need for it, and finally present it to the world in accessible manner.

                <p>
                    I am not sure if I am the best person to decide on that topic, or to give my advice, taken I focus mostly on logic of my applications, which is rather hard to visually convey, I think I can still produce some good ideas about presenting your work. Let me focus on mobile apps and website, as I know how to work with them.
                </p>
                <h4>Summarize your work on the project.</h4>
                <p>
                    You know what you did on a task: whether it’s implementing the user reports, designing icons for UI, programming networking algorithms, or tweaking colours to add dark mode. Spend some time pointing out which parts of the project are your own. It will help you when somebody asks exactly what your specialisation is. It will help you realise what you like to do. It will show the world, what you can do. And if you did the whole project, from idea and design to publishing in App Store, write it down. Let people see how much work goes in all those apps.
                </p>

                <img src="../img/cards.jpg" alt="My portfolio cards">
                <h4>Start with the best.</h4>
                <p>
                    Things you are the proudest of will be in the spotlight at the top / start – most prominent, bold, and interesting. Do you know how many people go to second page on Google results? <a href="https://www.theleverageway.com/blog/how-far-down-the-search-engine-results-page-will-most-people-go/">About 5 percent.</a> This is why the order of your work matters – you have interest of people watching your work just for a very short time, and you have to make the best of it.

                </p>
                <h4>Name your favourites.</h4>
                <p>
                    A good name for project needs to have some meaning in it. Especially when it is in portfolio, because it is something you are very proud of. When you name it – it’s your own. That’s why on top of all the work you did, a name will make your work more complete and more desirable, even if it’s just something straight out of tutorial. It will give your project that much needed personality. And for pragmatists: named projects are easier to sort.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Yes, I can see what your app looks like. Even with that annoying overlay of new phone I still did not buy. But I want to do more. I want to see how your app is used. How easy it is to do that thing I am willing to pay £1.99 a month to do. Don’t overdo it and present all little functions (this should be done on specialised product site) but give me a quick look and feel of that one thing I will be doing over and over.

                    I have created a Chrome extension that is currently used by almost 7000 people all over the world. I have been invited to work with Electronic Arts.

Your portfolio is the place you present the best, most intense version of yourself, and there is absolutely no reason to be humble. Write down all the big successes, and make your awesome self stand out.
